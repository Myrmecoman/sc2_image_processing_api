Feel free to provide ideas / help on github !

Get rid of the OCR and use pattern matching (should be faster + no burden of installing more libraries)
Make the screenshot_maker class safer from segmentation errors.
Provide info if building can be built here instead of reading minerals.
Detect buildable terrain (certainly only feasible using CNNs).
Build a CNN for basically any object detection.
