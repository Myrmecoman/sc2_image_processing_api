Feel free to provide ideas / help on github !

Get rid of the OCR and use pattern matching (should be faster + no burden of installing more libraries)
Make the screenshot_maker class safer from segmentation errors.
Provide info if building is can be built here instead of reading minerals.
Detect mineral patches to be able to tell workers to go back to mining.
Detect buildable terrain (certainly only feasible using CNNs)
