# In depth explanation of the hotkey helper class

This class contains a few functions and global variables to do actions using the keys instead of clicking buttons. This speeds up the usage of commands in the game since we do not have to wait for the UI to update in order to click another button.

For more info see the hotkey_helper.py file.
